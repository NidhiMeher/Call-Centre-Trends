# Call-Centre-Trends
 Call Centre Trends Visualising customer and agent behaviour.

With the help of Power BI, I was able to explore call center data and uncover key insights on customer behavior and satisfaction levels. The dashboard displays metrics such as call volume, call duration, wait time, and customer satisfaction scores, allowing for a comprehensive view of call center performance.

One of the most interesting findings was that customers who had to wait on hold for longer time were significantly more likely to rate their experience as negative. Armed with this information, I was able to develop recommendations for reducing wait times, such as adding more call center staff during peak hours.

I'm proud to have been part of this project and look forward to continuing to use Power BI to unlock insights and drive business results. Thank you PwC and Forage for offering this kind of virtual internship.
